The aim of this bachelorâ€™s thesis is to investigate the efficiency and application
of machine learning algorithms to predict the future price of a chosen cryptocurrency. The
first half of the paper deals with a brief description of cryptocurrencies and the
technology backing the whole ecosystem. Following an evaluation of traditional
methodologies used to forecast financial times series and how the cryptocurrency
market reacts to the application of these methods. Appropriate features are engineered
from data-sets of selected cryptocurrencies and applied to the machine
learning algorithms. These algorithms are eventually tested. Their performances
are reviewed and a conclusion is drawn from the results.
